                    This product has been designed with the highest concern for safety. However, any
                    electrical device, if used improperly, has the potential for causing fire, electrical
                    shock or personal injury. To help ensure accident-free operation, follow these
                    guidelines:
                </p>
                <code>Observe all warnings, precautions and instructions.</code>
                <code><br>Stop use and unplug the AC power cord from the electrical outlet immediately if
                    the device functions in an abnormal manner or produces unusual sounds or smells.</code>
                <code><br>Contact the appropriate PlayStation® customer service helpline which can be
                    found within every PlayStation® and PlayStation®2 format software manual if the
                    device does not operate properly.
                </code>
               <p>Safety:</p>
               <ul>
                 <li>
                    Do not remove the console exterior or disassemble the console. The laser beam
                    emitted from the lens of this unit may be harmful to the eyes.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Do not use the console near water.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Keep the console and all connecting cords and cables out of the reach of children.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Do not touch the plug of the AC power cord with wet hands
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Do not touch the console or connected accessories during an electrical storm.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Do not touch the console or AC adaptor for extended periods of time while the
                    console is turned on as extended contact may cause low-temperature burns
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Do not place the console and connected accessories on the floor or in a place where
                    they may cause persons walking by to trip or stumble. 
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Adjust the settings of the DVD player according to the instructions provided before
                    playing a DVD. If the settings are not correct, a loud sound may be emitted,
                    possibly injuring your ears or damaging the speakers.
                 </li>
               </ul>
               <p>Health:</p>
               <ul>
                <li>
                    Stop using the console immediately if you experience any of the following
                    symptoms. If the condition persists, consult a doctor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When operating the unit, play in a well-lit room and keep a safe distance from the
                     TV screen.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Avoid prolonged use of the console. Take a break of about 15 minutes during every
                    hour of play.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do not use the console when you are tired or short of sleep
                </li>
                <li>
                    Listening to sound continuously for a long time with a high volume may adversely
                    affect the ears. Be careful especially when using headphones. Adjust the volume
                    so that surrounding sounds can be heard.
